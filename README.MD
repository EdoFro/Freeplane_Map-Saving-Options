# Description

**'Map Saving Options'** is a **Freeplane AddOn** that gives you the possibility to add **saving preferences** to **each** of your **maps**.

Mindmaps can be used for different purposes and saving information like node's modification times depends most of the times on the map itself, its content and use case.

With this AddOn you can define if a map have to save the information of any of these:

* folded and unfolded nodes
* selected node when saving
* *Creation* and *Modification times* of each node

This way, you can define for each map if it will use the **central Freeplane preferences**, its own or a mix of both.

# Do I need this AddOn?

I don't know if you do, but I do! That's why I created it. Let me explain.

I use Freeplane for multiple pourposes and work with different types of maps.

For example, I use **maps for projects** I work in and use Freeplane to anotate all meetings agreements, pending tasks, relevant information, received data and files, etc. In these types of maps to have the creation and modification times of nodes can be very useful when searching for anotations done in a specific day or week for example.

I also use **maps as workbooks**, where the modification time information has no use. But sometimes I have to compare different versions of the same map and this extra information only makes things harder (for example when using **GIT** versioning and commiting changes)

![MSO_Image_002.png](file:/C:/Users/Edo/Documents/GitHub/Freeplane_Map-Saving-Options/Resources/MSO_Image_002.png)

Here you can define if the current map will have its own saving preferences or if it should use the ones defined in the **Freeplane Preferences Dialog**.

If you decide that it should have its own preferences, then a second dialog opens. There you can define the saving options for the map:

## 3. Saving map

When using the saving command in the menu, the AddOn uses the defined preferences for the map.
 

After saving the status bar shows a message indicating the preferences used for saving the map:

# This AddOn is still beta

So it may have a lot of bugs. Use it at your own risk. (**Freeplane** has an excelent "*Undo*" implementation, so the risk is in fact very limited)

Please report any bug in this addOn in its GitHub page
